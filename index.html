                <p>Thank you for always being there in my life and always looking out for me. You always made me feel special and encouraged me all along the way. I know these are things that parents are supposed to do for their children, but I don't think anyone else could have done it any better.

                <p>I may not tell you often, but I love you so much that my day starts with thinking about you and ends looking forward to seeing you. I strongly believe that “Behind every successful man there is a woman inspiring him.” Yes! I proudly tell my friends that without your support and encouragement I would not have been where I am now. There were so many days when I promised to take you out, but had to cancel. You had to sacrifice so much for me, and all that you did with a smile on your face.</p>

                <p>You have always been proud of my accomplishments and accepting of my failures. You never let me give up on my dreams, no matter what obstacles were in my way. You have always believed in me, even when there were times I didn't even believe in myself.</p>

                <p>When I receive compliments for being a sincere and hardworking person, I thank you in my mind. I am who I am because of you. It is your love and upbringing that has made me into a fine gentleman.</p>
